00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,690
welcome to my house tour

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:07,450
before we go into the house let's quickly look at the entry

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,670
from outside and now

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:10,270
we

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,260
go through the outer entry

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,070
and

7
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:13,830
enter

8
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:14,360
the

9
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:15,400
entrance hall

10
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,050
now here on the left

11
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:18,890
is a small

12
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,550
bathroom it is tiled

13
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,160
there is a

14
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:22,800

15
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:23,500
toilet

16
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:23,980
and

17
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:26,810
that's basically all of this tiled bathroom

18
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:33,410
then let's quickly go back into the entrance

19
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,100
and i'll just quickly close the door

20
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:38,990

21
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:42,800
now let's continue

22
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:44,900
on the right

23
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:49,100

30
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,480
and that's basically it

31
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:06,890

32
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,110
